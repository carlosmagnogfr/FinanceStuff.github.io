**Python Code:** [Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/jtsulliv/ML-from-scratch/tree/master/Neural-Networks)

The single-layer [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is the simplest of the artificial neural networks (ANNs).  It was developed by American psychologist [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) in the 1950s.  

Like Logistic Regression, the Perceptron is a linear classifier used for binary predictions.  This means that in order for it to work, the data must be [linearly separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability).
